# Example playbook for installing OMERO.server into a VM
#
# This is initially aimed at testing a mini-IDR, so some production tuning is
# required (limits.d).
# In addition the samba-client and python-pydata roles are also installed
# as they are required for some IDR related tasks.
# For a standard production server you won't need these.


# Testing vars. Set:
# - `idr_net_iface=iface` if your servers use a network interface other
#   then eth0 for inter-machine networking

- hosts: >
    {{ idr_environment | default('idr') }}-database-hosts

  roles:
  - role: openmicroscopy.postgresql


# There are two OMERO rw and database servers, and multiple OMERO ro.
# The next two plays set a hostvar so that the OMERO servers connect to
# the correct database

- hosts: "{{ idr_environment | default('idr') }}-omero-hosts"
  tasks:
  - name: Get database host
    set_fact:
      omero_db_host_ansible: "{{ hostvars[groups[idr_environment | default('idr') + '-database-hosts'][0]]['ansible_' + (idr_net_iface | default('eth0'))]['ipv4']['address']}}"


# Currently there's a bug in OMERO read-only which means the database
# must have been written to at least once by the current server version
# The easiest way to do this is do:
# - deploy a persistent read-write server which listens on localhost only
# - bring up the servers in the required order

# Vars are in
# - group_vars/omero-hosts.yml
# - group_vars/omeroreadwrite-hosts.yml
# - group_vars/omeroreadonly-hosts.yml
