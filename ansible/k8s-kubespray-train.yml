# Kubespray includes a playbook with it's own set of groups.
# We can either copy and modify the playbook to match our group name,
# or dynamically add hosts to the required kubespray groups.
# This does the latter.
#
# Requires Ansible 2.4.
#
# We don't need kubespray's bastion handling because our custo openstack
# dynamic inventory will automatically setup the SSH ProxyCommand
#
# WARNING: Since we have two separate clusters we must clear the
# dynamically created groups before running kubespray on other clusters
