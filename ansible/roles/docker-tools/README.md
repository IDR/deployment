Docker Tools
============

Install Python based docker tools, such as `docker-compose`.

This uses a mix of python modules from yum and modules installed globally with `pip`.

If your system hosts multiple services you should use a virtualenv (not currently implemented by this role) instead of installing docker-compose globally.
