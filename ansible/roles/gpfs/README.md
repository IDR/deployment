GPFS
====

Extracts GPFS RPMs from the distributed installer package and compiles a kernel module.
Installs RPMs and kernel module on a GPFS client.

The easiest and default way to use this role is with a GPFS yum repository (there are no public repositories so you must find your own).
This will install the base GPFS RPMs, install the build-dependencies for the kernel GPFS module, compile it for the current running kernel and install it.

If you have more complex requirements, including applying custom patches, installing additional GPFS server protocols such CES, or do not have a yum repository, see the advanced instructions.


Requirements
------------

If you have access to a GPFS yum repository and are happy for a development toolchain to be installed on all your GPFS nodes set `gpfs_repo_url_base` and `gpfs_repo_url_updates` to point to your repositories if they haven't already been configured.


Role Variables
--------------

If you need to configure a yum repository for GPFS packages set these variables:
- `gpfs_repo_url_base`: URL to the base packages in a GPFS yum repository
- `gpfs_repo_url_updates`: URL to the updates packages in a GPFS yum repository


Example Playbook
----------------

    - hosts: gpfs-client-nodes
      roles:
      - role: gpfs
        gpfs_repo_url_base: http://example.org/pub/gpfs/x86_64/4.2.0/base
        gpfs_repo_url_updates: http://example.org/pub/gpfs/x86_64/4.2.0/updates


Advanced Instructions
=====================

Advanced users can use this role to allow GPFS RPMs to be extracted, and the kernel module built, on a single node, and for the RPMs and kernel module to be installed on other nodes.
This means only one node needs to contain a kernel development environment, and this node does not need to be an active GPFS client node (for example a plain CentOS 7 virtual machine is sufficient).
You must set `gpfs_repoinstall: False`.

After extracting and building the RPMs and kernel module they will be copied to the local machine (the one that's running Ansible).
The install part of this role will take the locally copied RPMs, send them to the nodes on which GPFS should be deployed, and install them.
The GPFS binaries path will be added to `PATH` in `/root/.bash_profile`.
Also note that the GPFS control servers need to be able to ssh into all servers as root.
This role will enable root access in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, and you should provide a list of public keys in `gpfs_public_keys`.


Requirements (Building)
-----------------------

Set `gpfs_build: True` and `gpfs_repoinstall: False`.
Ensure all system packages are updated.
The GPFS kernel module will be compiled for the kernel currently running on the machine (so reboot if it has been updated).
This role will attempt to install the following kernel-related packages if they are missing:

- kernel-devel
- kernel-headers
- kernel-tools
- kernel-tools-libs

However if you are running an older kernel it is sometimes possible for a more recent version of these packages to be automatically installed, which will lead to failure of the kernel module build.
To avoid these problems it is highly recommended that you install these packages first and verify that their versions match the kernel version exactly.

Ensure the GPFS installer packages are in `gpfs_package_source_dir`, default location is the `files/` directory of this role.
The extracted and built RPMs will be copied into `gpfs_local_rpm_dir` which must be defined.


Requirements (Installing)
-------------------------

Set `gpfs_install: True` and `gpfs_repoinstall: False`.
Ensure the kernel corresponding to the built GPFS module is installed.
Ensure `gpfs_local_rpm_dir` contains the extracted and built RPMs.


Role Variables
--------------

You will need to override many of the variables in `defaults/main.yml`, depending on your GPFS version.

- `gpfs_build`: If True extract and build GPFS RPMs. You will need to run with this set on at least one node, but note the build node doesn't have to be an active GPFS client since it's purely used for extracting and building packages (default False)
- `gpfs_install`: If True (default) install GPFS using RPMs provided in a local directory, this should be True unless you are only extracting/building the GPFS RPMs
- `gpfs_configure`: If True (default same as `gpfs_install`) configure the system, including SSH access and local GPFS options.
- `gpfs_kernel_version`: Compile/install the GPFS module for this kernel version
- `gpfs_local_rpm_dir`: A local directory to which the extracted/built RPMs can be copied from the build node and subsequently deployed onto other nodes (mandatory, no default).
- `gpfs_package_source_dir`: A local path to a directory containing the GPFS packages (default `files/`)
- `gpfs_install_check_kernel_version`: If True check that the currently running kernel version matches that of the compiled GPFS kernel module. Set to False if you are upgrading the kernel and GPFS kernel module at the same time.
- `gpfs_public_keys`: A list of the SSH public keys belonging to the root users on the NSD nodes, needed so that the NSD nodes can connect to this GPFS client node (default: don't configure)
- `gpfs_node_specific_mount_options`: A dictionary of special mount options for a specific node only, for example to make one node mount GPFS as read-only: `gpfs-name: ro`, to remove custom mount options set the dictionary value to empty: `gpfs-name: `.
Never edit `/etc/fstab` directly.

- `gpfs_enable_systemd_workaround`: Workaround a bug in GPFS v4.1 when used with systemd-219, (default False)

For convenience you may want to define some variables on the command line, e.g. `-e gpfs_local_rpm_dir=/data/gpfs/rpms -e gpfs_package_source_dir=/data/gpfs/src`.

Example Playbook
----------------

    # Build GPFS on one node (this must be run before installing GPFS anywhere)
    - hosts: gpfs-build-node
      roles:
      - gpfs
      vars:
      - gpfs_build: True
      - gpfs_install: False
      - gpfs_repoinstall: False
      - gpfs_local_rpm_dir: /data/gpfs/rpms

    # Install and configure GPFS on client nodes:
    - hosts: gpfs-client-nodes
      roles:
      - gpfs
      vars:
      #(Default) gpfs_build: False
      - gpfs_install: True
      - gpfs_repoinstall: False
      - gpfs_local_rpm_dir: /data/gpfs/rpms
      - gpfs_public_keys:
          - ssh-rsa AAAA1...
          - ssh-rsa AAAA2...

    # Configure GPFS only (assumes GPFS has already been installed):
    - hosts: gpfs-client-nodes
      roles:
      - gpfs
      vars:
      #(Default) gpfs_build: False
      - gpfs_install: False
      - gpfs_repoinstall: False
      - gpfs_configure: True
    - gpfs_public_keys:
        - ssh-rsa AAAA1...
        - ssh-rsa AAAA2...


Additional Notes
----------------

- An earlier version of this role used parameters extensively.
  However, the addition of the GPFS patch package complicates things since the names of packages aren't completely consistent, so for many tasks it's easier to hardcode things.
- The GPFS patch refuses to install unless some of the original installer packages are present.
- This role contains additional internal patches for GPFS which may be fixed in the next release.
- Possible todo: Don't re-copy when building and installing on the same node
