# Example playbook for installing OMERO.server into a VM
# This is initially aimed at testing a mini-IDR, so some production tuning is
# required (limits.d)

# Set hosts to all so this can be run locally, or pushed out to any testing VM.
# If you are going to use this as part of a production playbook you should
# change this to a host-group to avoid accidents.
